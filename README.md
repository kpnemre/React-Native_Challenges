# React-Native_Challenges

There lots of React-Native prjocets in this repo.
I collected all in one repo because creating react native project files take long time and lots of files are
same every project.

Every challenges filed own file.

Work on a challenge and emulate it, firstly :you can introduce that challenge to index.js file. forexample :
For Challenge_4 ;

import {AppRegistry} from 'react-native';

import Login from './Challenge_4_LoginPage/Login';

import {name as appName} from './app.json';

AppRegistry.registerComponent(appName, () => Login);

You should make this changing every challenge.

Happy Coding...
